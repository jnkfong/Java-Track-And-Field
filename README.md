## Description
Java Track and Field is a high school project to learn further more about UI development using Java Swing and import/exporting data into a desktop application. Simple implementations such as adding, editing and deleting realm data objects was applied. Future implementations would be to use Oracle DB to store each client's content and use Oracle Weblogic to host a War file to allow web access rather than solely desktop. RESTful API implementation using AJAJ/AJAX would also be beneficial.
